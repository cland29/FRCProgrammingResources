# FRC Programming Resources

## Overview
After years of posting to [Chief Delphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/) about different resources, I finally decided to post them all in one spot! How exciting! This hopefully give an overview of multiple different resources available. This is an actively growing list, so if you see something you think would be beneficial, send me a message on chief and I'll take a look! Please let me know if there is anything that seems out of date or inaccurate.
All resources on this document are free unless otherwise noted. While I stick mainly to free material, some resources I've read have been worth the money. I am not sponsored by any of these companies/authors.
This document is primarily made for Java programmers. Some resources can be used for other programming languages as well, but are not officially supported by this document.
